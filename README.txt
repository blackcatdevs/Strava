This is an ongoing personal project to bring two things that I enjoy - running and cycling and tech. I record running and cycling activities using my Garmin Fenix sports watch and this syncs to the Garmin phone app from where it is shared with Strava. Strava provides some reports on the app and website but also offers access to data via their API, so this seemed like a good opportunity to learn about making API calls, processing the data into a more suitable format and building some PowerBI reports on it.

The solution will be built around a SQL Server database, using SSIS to manage an ELT workflow, transforming the data returned by API call into a dimensionalised structure for PowerBI reporting. I'll be developing in Visual Studio, using Github and Jira integration to underpin Agile / DevOps techniques. So lots of fun technology and techniques, maybe some others as well too?

This will all be stored in a public Git repository so that anyone can reuse it.
