Task: 
Scheduled daily download of the last n days of activities are periodically downloaded from Strava and loaded into the DB

Outcome:
The last n days of activities are donwloaded and inserted into the Landing.Activities table. Since the API call uses the activity date 
and not the activity amended date, and cumulative values (eg kudos) for the activity can be expected to increase for a few days after 
the activity is uploaded to Strava - it is necessary to download the same activity multiple times during a window of n days, so the 
Landing.Activities table will hae mutliple records for the same activity.

The Staging.Activities table should only contain a single record for each activity that is updated when the cumulative values change 
in subsequent downloads of the activity from Strava.      

Additional Notes:


Assumptions:
The Landing.Activities table has already been populated with historic data - the script for this uses the most recent activity 
date so would need rewriting if the table contains recent activities but not historic activities.

Acceptance Criteria:
The scheduled job runs every day and expected activities are present in the Landing.Activities table and in the Staging.Activities 
table as a unique record for each activity with cumulative values (eg kudos) correct as of the last download of the record.

Risks:
N/A
