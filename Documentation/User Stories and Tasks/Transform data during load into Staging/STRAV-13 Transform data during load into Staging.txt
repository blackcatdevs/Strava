Task: 
Transform data during load into Staging

Outcome:
The columns in the Staging.Activities use more appropriate datatypes, and the transformation from NVARCHARs is handled 
by the GetActivities package. 

Additional Notes:
DIM_activity_type is necessarily modelled as a type 0 (retain original) slowly changing dimension because the Strava API does not export the 
activity_type in normalized form hence there is no key to differentiate a changed (but similar to existing) value from a new 
(but similar to existing) value. 

DIM_date is also a type 0 - as expected for a date dimension.

Assumptions:
N/A

Acceptance Criteria:
The Staging.Activities table is rebuilt with new column datatypes and the GetActivites package runs without error.

Risks:
N/A
