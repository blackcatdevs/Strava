As a: Strava user 
I want to: build visualisations for my activity data 
So that: I can see trends over time and gain insights into my fitness


Tech Spec

A SQL Server database and table structure will be created to hold Strava activity, and will be populated via Strava API calls. There will be an initial load(s) of historic data 
since 2015 and thereafer a daily load of the last 2 days of activities.

Values that relate to the activity itself (eg speed/distance) are fixed at the point that it is ended and pushed from the device to Garmin to Strava. 
However, Strava specific activity values (eg activity title) can be modified after being initially set and Kudos and comments are added over time - although they are unlikely 
to change more than a day or so after the activity is uploaded as it will drop down the feeds of other Strava users. So provision needs to be made for updating activities 
that have changed after the initial export. 

An SSIS package will be deployed to the catalogue of the Strava DB and run daily by a SQL Agent job - this will handle the following:

The daily load will populate a table in the Landing schema that is truncated before each load is processed.

Data from the Landing schema will be either inserted into or used to update existing records in a table in the Staging schema. 

After 2 days has elapsed from the date of the activity the staging record will be considered stable Data and will then be transformed and used to populate the final tables which will have a dimensional structure. 

PowerBI reports will be developed using the final tables as a source. 


Acceptance Criteria

Activity data is available and accurate as of the previous day

Activity data is suitably structured for PowerBI reporting
